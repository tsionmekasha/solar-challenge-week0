    "## 2. Metric Comparison\n",
    "- Boxplots of GHI, DNI, DHI for all three countries (one plot per metric, colored by country).\n",
    "- Summary table comparing mean, median, and standard deviation of GHI, DNI, DHI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Statistical Testing (optional)\n",
    "- Run one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis on GHI to check for significant differences.\n",
    "- Note p-values in notebook (for final submission).\n",

    "## 4. Key Observations (Markdown)\n",
    "- Bullet points of what stands out.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - Country X has highest median GHI.\n",
    "    - Country Y has most variable DNI.\n",
    "    - Togo has most stable DHI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Visual Summary\n",
    "- Small bar chart ranking countries by average GHI.\n"
